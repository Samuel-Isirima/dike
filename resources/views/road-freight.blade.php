                                When goods have to be delivered to your customer's door, road freight is still
                                indispensable. And will remain so in future. In recent years, AsussXpress has
                                expanded the options for European distribution by road freight by adding dozens of
                                lanes. We make up our own daily schedules for packed product lines. This applies both to
                                full and part truck loads.

                                        KPIs. Thanks to our modern tracking & tracing systems, we measure and evaluate
